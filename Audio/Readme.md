<b><i>To fabricate a prototype, follow the following:</b></i>
1. Connect Your wireless buds to your computer system.
2. Make sure the buds are selected as the default input device.
3. Make changes in the code if required.
4. Run the code and the recording will start.
5. We used magnet to hold the bud on to the mask;
   This particular variant had magnets inbuilt near the charging port.

*NOTE:*<br>
The code was written and tested on the IDLE IDE on a windows laptop.<br>
Check for any platform dependency if you run on a different platform.
